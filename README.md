# Trying to find the highest number from 5 numbers + Apology
# Again, I'm sorry for my tardiness,
# I know it doesn't make sense to apologize and immediately do it again the next possible opportunity
# So, I will do my best to pass the assigned task/s early, going forward 
# For now, I will accept any deduction or punishment you see fit for my consecutive tardiness
